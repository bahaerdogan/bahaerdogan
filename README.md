## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
I am a very curious man who has adopted the principle of continuous self-improvement. I do research and reading on history, artificial intelligence, finance, engineering, space, mathematics, physics, politics and psychology. I also write articles about some of them.

One year before the end of the first quarter of the 21st century, I had the opportunity to travel extensively in around 15 countries. I made detailed evaluations about their main cities and only incomplete evaluations about their secondary and tertiary settlements. I was grateful for the beauties of our country and developed policies for the aspects that could be improved.
